## Hario Mini Mill Grinder overview

### Intro

The Hario Mini Mill Slim  grinder is a steady and portable grinder.
Alas, the grinder has no marked settings for how course the grind is. Here are some of my preferences.

### Instructions

To adjust the grinder, turn the wheel on the bottom of the upper part. The wheel will make a clicking sound when adjusting. Right is finer, left is more course. The base is closed (finest) setting. All values are therefore counted from finest to course.

| Method | Clicks |
| ---   | ---     |
| Aeropress (inverted) |Â 7 - 10 |
| Chemex / pour-over | 9 - 12 |
| French Press | 15 - 16 |
