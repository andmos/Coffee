## Hario V60 01 Plastic - Single cup, full bodied

### Intro

Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filter. This method works great with light, sweet coffee (like African), giving it a full-body taste.

* 230 gr water
* 17 gr freshly ground coffee, a bit finer than filter grind
* 35 sec bloom time

### Instructions

* Pre-heat the cup or serving kettle.
* Moister the filter and put it in the V60, on top of the cup or kettle.
* Add the coffee and make a little well in the middle of the grounds with a finger.
* Add 35 gr of water in circular movements, starting in the middle of the coffee. Make sure all the grounds are wet.
* Set a timer for 35 seconds and let the coffee bloom.
* After 35 seconds, pour water up to 150 grams in circular movements.
* At 150 grams, give the V60 a couple of swirls to keep the coffee bed flat. This helps with extraction.
* Pour the rest of the water in a circular fashion, up to 230 grams.
* Give the V60 a last swirl.
* The brew should take between 2 minutes / 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

### Note

The total brew time may vary depending on the paper filter used in the V60, as well as the grind.
