## Chemex / pour over coffee maker

### Intro

Cold brew coffee is a great replacement for instant-coffee. A batch of cold brew can stay in the fridge for as much as a week. Use filtered water and clean equipment. A Chemex or a kitchen jug  works great for a cold brew.

### 1 Liter batch

* 1 liter of filtered water at around room temperature
* 250 gram freshly ground coffee. Grind it coarse.

### Instructions

* Add the coffee to the Chemex.
* Add the water. Stir until all the coffee has been touched by the water.
* Put a cloth over the top of the Chemex.
* Leave the brew for 24 hours.
* After 24 hours, use a sieve and pour the coffee into a bowl or jar. The sieve will filter out the roughest parts of the coffee grounds.
* Clean the Chemex and prepare the paper filter (remember to moisten the filter).
* Pour the coffee over the filter and back in the Chemex.
* Use a drip filter holder (like the Hario V60 dripper or the filter holder from a Moccamaster) and prepare a new paper filter (remember to moisten the filter)
* Put the dripper over a glass jar and pour the coffee over the filter.
* Put the jar in the fridge - the batch is done.
* For iced coffee, fill a glass with ice cubes and pour coffee over it. If the brew is too strong, dilute with some cold water.
* For a hot cup of coffee, put the cold brew in the cup and add hot water at a 1/3 ratio.
