## Single cup - Tim Wendelboe's regular method

### Intro

Regular method by Aeropress champion Tim Wendelboe. [YouTube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JISZNixkeA).
Works best with lighter roasts. The variable here is the grind. If the drink turns out too weak, grind more fine, or courser if bitter.

Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filter. Pre-heat the cup.

* 200 gr water
* 14 gr freshly ground coffee, around medium filter. Taste and tune the grind to the liking.

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.
* Add the coffee.
* Pour the water over the coffee and stir 3 times.
* Put on the Aeropress plunger and pull it slightly upwards to stop the water from going through the coffee.
* Set a timer for 1 minute and let the coffee sit.
* When time is up, remove the plunger and stir 3 times.
* Use the plunger to press all the water through. This should take around 30 seconds.

### Note

* It's fine to press the plunger all the way, there is no real danger of overextraction here.

## Single cup - James Hoffmann's Ultimate Aeropress Technique

### Intro

From World Barista Champion and Youtube star James Hoffmann, his [Ultimate Aeropress Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc).
Recipe with high extraction for lighter roasts at a low coffee to water ratio.

Always use clean water. Pre-heat the cup. There is no need to rinse the paper filter.

* 200 gr water
* 11 gr freshly ground coffee, on the finer end of filter or pour-over, nearly at espresso-level.

* Ready the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.
* Add the coffee.
* Pour the water over the coffee evenly, make sure to get all the coffee wet.
* Put on the Aeropress plunger and pull it slightly upwards to stop the water from going through the coffee.
* Set a timer for 2 minute and let the coffee sit.
* When time is up, grab the upper and lower parts of the Aeropress and give it a gentle swirl.
* Wait for another 30 seconds.
* Use the plunger to press all the water through. Press gently and evenly. The press should take around 30 seconds.

### Note

* It's fine to press the plunger all the way, there is no real danger of overextraction here.
* For darker roasts, don't grind as fine, something around filter / pour-over should work.
* For lighter roasts, water temperature up to boiling is fine - but lower the temperature a bit for darker roasts.

## Single cup - Odd-Steinar Tøllefsen's inverted method

### Intro

Reversed method by World Champion Odd-Steinar Tøllefsen from Supreme Roastworks in Oslo, Norway. Example done with Ethiopian light roast coffee with a filter grind.

* 200 gr water
* 14 gr freshly ground coffee, filter.

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder.
* Set up the Aeropress reverse from what you would normally do (the rubber plunger pointing up).
* Attach the other part of the Aeropress on top of the rubber plunger.
* Add the coffee to the reversed press.
* Pour 200 grams of water over the coffee.
* Stir lightly 2-3 times back and forth.
* Let the coffee sit for 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
* Again, stir lightly 2-3 times back and forth.
* Press down slowly for about 20 to 30 seconds, stop at hissing sound.

### Note

* When pressing the plunger down, the weight of the hands should be enough. If the pressing has a heavy feel, try a more course grind, or finer if pressing feels too light.

## Single cup - Espresso-like brew, regular style

### Intro

The Aeropress can never make _true espresso_, since that requires a pressure of 9 bar. But it can come pretty close.
This method is used to create a concentrate that can be used for other coffee drinks, or as is. Works well with most types of coffee.

Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filters. Pre-heat the cup.

* 110 gr water
* 32 gr freshly ground coffee, somewhere between filter and espresso.

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.
* Add the coffee.
* Pour the water over the coffee and stir for 10 full seconds.
* Use the Aeropress plunger to press the water through the grounds for 20 seconds.

### Note

* For the best result, the brew process should take no more than 30 seconds.

## Single cup - Espresso-like brew, double filters

### Intro

The Aeropress can never make _true espresso_, since that requires a pressure of 9 bar. But it can come pretty close.
This method is used to create a concentrate that can be used for other coffee drinks, or as is. Espresso beans tastes best.

Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filters. Pre-heat the cup.

* Ca. 108 - 110 gr water

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.

* Moister a second filter and put in on top of the grounds inside the chamber.
* Use something like a cylindrical spice container to press the second filter down, compressing the grounds.
* Twist and pull up the compression device, leaving the second filter in place.
* Pour water over the second filter.
* Use the Aeropress plunger to press the water through the grounds.

### Note

* If the plunger is impossible to press down, the coffee grind might be too fine.
