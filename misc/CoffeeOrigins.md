# Coffee origins

## Intro

Coffee originates from many countries with its own distinguishing taste. This is a translation of Norwegian coffee importer [Solberg & Hansen's](https://sh.no/map/) guide to what characterizes each area's unique taste.

## South America

### Brazil

* Nuts
* Chocolate
* Dried fruit

Brazil is the country that produces the most coffee in the world. The variation in landscape and climate in the large country gives a huge production potential. Brazil is a high-tech coffee country where coffee is grown on everything from large farms and heavy plantations to smaller family-run farms. Part of the operation is mechanized and some farmers harvest the coffee berries mechanically. On smaller farms, they harvest the berries by hand. It is common for coffee to be wholly or partly dried, but you will also find wet-processed coffee.

### Colombia

* Cherry
* Stone fruit
* Chocolate

Coffee has been grown in Colombia since the early 19th century. They are one of the largest coffee producers in the world and the spectacular Andean Mountains offer ideal growing conditions for coffee. Mountain cliffs provide moisture and cool temperatures, and the variation in microclimate ties up with distinctive flavors against different coffee regions. High above the sea in hilly terrain, coffee is grown on small, family-run farms where small farmers are responsible for the coffee production. The farmers often cooperate in groups or cooperatives, and the coffee beans are mostly processed in the wet.

### Peru

* Red berries
* Citrus
* Caramel
* Cocoa

In Peru, the landscape is created for coffee, with steep ridges, deep rainforest and fresh sea air. Coffee has been grown in Peru since the 18th century, but varying climates and lack of infrastructure have created challenges for production and made it difficult to find quality coffee. The coffee farmers in Peru have very small farms and smaller washing stations. The coffee berries are hand-picked, and many of the farmers carry the coffee on foot or with mules. Organic coffee has made the country an important player in organic coffee production.

## Africa

### Kenya

* Blackcurrant
* Red berries
* Citrus

In Mount Kenya's slopes, the coffee trees grow in rich, red, volcanic soil, often without shade. English colonial masters took the initiative to grow coffee in Kenya, but the coffee culture first gained a foothold in the country in the late 1900s. The coffee is grown by small farmers who deliver the coffee berries to a common washing station in the surrounding area, where the beans are wet-processed. Several hundred coffee farmers may be associated with a washing station. The prayers are hand-sorted by size. Two types of prayer, in particular, have helped to give Kenyan coffee its good reputation: SL 28 and SL 34. Batian, a new leaf rust-resistant bean type, is also used. It also becomes Ruiru, which is resistant to CBD.

### Ethiopia

* Citrus
* Bergamot
* Floral tones

Ethiopia is said to be the origin of coffee. Coffee and accompanying coffee ceremonies are an important part of the country's culture. Here the descendants of the first arabica plants grow with traces back to the 17th century and the diversity of species is enormous. The Rift Valley provides fruitful mountain landscapes with mineral soils, cool temperatures and plenty of rain. Most of the Ethiopian coffee is grown by small farmers in smaller pieces of land. Different species of the coffee plant grow wild, side by side, with varieties of heirloom as dominant bean types. The coffee farmers are faithful to their ancient farming traditions and cultivate natural principles. It processes both processed and dry-dried coffee.

### Burundi

* Flowers
* Stone fruit
* Berries

In the heart of Africa, unexplored areas of great potential have made Burundi an exciting coffee nation with unique taste profiles. Coffee was introduced in the 1930s, but production has faced challenges. The country is one of the world's poorest and lives with the aftermath of a long civil war. Coffee production was governed until 2007, which made it difficult to distinguish batches from specific cultivation areas, farms and cooperatives. Thus, the coffee quality was long underestimated and overlooked, but this is no longer the case. The foundation for growing premium coffee is brilliant, with moist climate and volcanic soil up to 2000 meters above sea level. Both variations in soil and different types of beans, often local varieties of bourbon, offer unique taste experiences.

### Rwanda

* Dried fruits
* Red berries
* Orange

In rich volcanic soil, the coffee trees were planted in Rwanda in the early 1900s. Today, coffee is an important export product that has contributed in particular to economic growth and optimism in the aftermath of the gruesome genocide in 1994. Coffee production creates new jobs and there are several female coffee farmers who run their own farms. New washing stations provide farmers with better access to resources and knowledge, and focus is focused on producing and refining high-quality coffee. Rwanda's endless green and rounded mountain peaks provide a good breeding ground for this particular, where you will find old coffee beans with the bourbon type in the lush vegetation.

## Asia and Oceania

### Indonesia

* Stone fruit
* Cocoa
* Dried fruit
* Nuts

Coffee came with the colonists to Indonesia in the late 17th century and was exported already in the early 18th century. Exports have played an important role in the development of the country, which today is one of the largest coffee producers in the world. Most of the coffee grown is robust. Some Arabica is grown, mainly on the island of Sulawesi. The differences in microclimates and vegetation from island to island offer great variations in taste. There are several different types of prayer and because of the very humid climate, the beans are usually processed wet.

### India

* Chocolate
* Tobacco
* Spices
* Vanilla

India has a long and proud coffee tradition with roots dating back to the 17th century. They grow coffee under shade trees, often with other crops such as spices or fruits. In southern India, both robust and arabica are cultivated, and the types of prayer offer different varieties. After harvesting, various processing methods are used, but the most characteristic of India is "monsooning". By monsooning, the coffee beans are exposed to the Asian monsoon where sea air, humid weather and heat make the beans swell and change color. This gives a completely different taste of sweet tobacco and vanilla, which has made monsoon coffee known worldwide.

### Papua New-Guinea

* Cocoa
* Tobacco
* Sweet, dark fruit

Papua New-Guinea is one of the world's least urbanized countries. It has magnificent scenery with jagged mountain peaks, active volcanoes, paradise-like sandy beaches and dense rain forests. There are more than a thousand different tribal cultures, many of them almost cut off from the modern world. Coffee is grown in the mountains on small farms or plantations and almost all the coffee is processed. Old coffee trees grow well in rich volcanic soil and coffee production is an important nutrient base for many local communities.

## Central America

### Guatemala

* Stone fruit
* Chocolate
* Flowers

In Guatemala, some of the world's finest and most distinctive coffee varieties are cultivated. The country is one of the largest climate variations in the world, where the variation in the climate in the various coffee regions gives different characteristics to the flavors. Most of the coffee is grown on small farms in smaller pieces of land. There it grows in fertile soil along the country's green-covered mountain ridges in natural shade from the many trees in the landscape. The farmers deliver the coffee berries to a common washing station if they do not have one themselves, but in addition to high-quality wet-processed coffee, they also have some berry-dried and partly dry-dried coffee.

### Nicaragua

* Chocolate
* Plum
* Caramel

Warm climate, nutritious soil, large shade trees and rich plant life give Nicaragua a long history of producing delicious coffee. Coffee is one of the main export goods in the country and provides many jobs. The coffee is often grown under trees among bustling flower life on small farms. It focuses on cultivating high-quality coffee while taking care of nature. The coffee is usually grown according to natural principles and processed both by wet processing and berry drying.

### Honduras

* Chocolate
* Vanilla
* Caramel

With moist jungle scenery along the feet of large mountains, there is much to do for good coffee in Honduras. Soil, altitude and climate vote, but poor infrastructure and lack of adequate washing stations have previously made it challenging for the country to process its own coffee. This has in recent decades changed with the focus on knowledge and new resources for the country's coffee industry. Today, Honduras can supply large amounts of tasty coffee with qualities among the world's foremost.

### El Salvador

* Chocolate
* Spices
* Caramel
* Apple

In El Salvador, the coffee trees grow in hillsides that creep up from the sea. The coffee plants are classified as forest and protect the local fauna. Here you will find coffee plants that are up to a hundred years old. The soil is rich and volcanic, and many farms are located in valley sites on active or dead volcanoes. The wind conditions make it demanding for production, which has created the characteristic chess-shaped coffee fields where screen trees protect the wind.

### Costa Rica

* Stone fruit
* Berries
* Floral tones

Costa Rica is a technical coffee country with a great focus on the farmer's knowledge. They protect their Arabica varieties and have banned the cultivation of robust. The coffee farms are often small, family-run and well run, where the knowledge has been passed down through generations. They often own their own micro mills so that the farmers have the opportunity to work with their prayers from start to finish. Honey-processed coffee originates in Costa Rica. It is a partially dry coffee where the peel of the mature coffee berry is removed, while much of the pulp is left around the bean while it is drying. It gives moisture and sweetness to the taste.
